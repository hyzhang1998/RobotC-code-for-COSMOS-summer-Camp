# RobotC code for COSMOS summer camp

In summer 2016, I went to the COSMOS engineering summer camp. For my final project with the group, We built a complex kinetic sculture that can sort the balls by their different colors and put them on different tracks. To do this we used the LEGO modules that uses RobotC as their programming system. I was responsible for the entirety of our coding part. I wrote the code to:

1. Calibrate the color sensor before initiation of the kinetic sculpture by putting the different color balls under the color sensor to record their color values.
2. Control the track so that different color balls go through different tracks.
3. Limit the number of balls in front of the ball launcher down to one.
4. Create a easy-to-use user interface with instructions for someone who has no knowledge of how to operate our sculpture. 

It was a long time ago, but I gained valuable communication skills, group work ability, and most importantly, problem-solving methods. To view the final product of our kinetic sculpture, please visit our group website at https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/2016-team-2/home or visit the youtube link for the demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB3n8vXknmg and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJDil4XUIA.

Thank you!
